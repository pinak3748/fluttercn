# Installation

Get fluttercn up and running in your Flutter project in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - for the CLI tool
- **Flutter SDK** - installed and configured on your machine
- **A Flutter project** - or create a new one

## Step 1: Install the CLI

Install fluttercn CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g fluttercn
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn global add fluttercn
```

## Step 2: Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your Flutter project directory and initialize fluttercn:

```bash
cd your-flutter-project
fluttercn init
```

This command will:
- Validate that you're in a Flutter project
- Create the theme configuration file at `lib/config/theme.dart`
- Set up the necessary structure for components

**Note:** You only need to run this once per project. If fluttercn is already initialized, you'll see a warning message.

## Step 3: Add Your First Component

Now you're ready to add components! First, let's see what's available:

```bash
fluttercn list
```

Or use the short alias:

```bash
fluttercn ls
```

Then add a component to your project:

```bash
fluttercn add button
```

Or add multiple components:

```bash
fluttercn add card
fluttercn add button
```

The components will be copied to `lib/widgets/common/` in your project, and you can start using them right away!

## What's Next?

- Browse all available [components](/docs/components)
- Learn about [theming](/docs/theming) your components
- Check out component examples and usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Flutter project validation failed">
    Make sure you're running the command from the root of your Flutter project (where `pubspec.yaml` is located).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="fluttercn is not initialized">
    Run `fluttercn init` first to set up fluttercn in your project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Component not found">
    Use `fluttercn list` to see all available components. Make sure you're using the correct component name (case-insensitive).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing required dependencies">
    Some components require the theme configuration. Make sure you've run `fluttercn init` before adding components.
