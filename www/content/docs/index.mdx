# Welcome to fluttercn

fluttercn is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible Flutter components that you can copy and paste directly into your apps. Think of it as your component library—built with Flutter, for Flutter developers.

## What is fluttercn?

fluttercn provides a set of high-quality, customizable UI components that follow Flutter's design principles. Unlike traditional packages, these components are **copied directly into your project**, giving you complete ownership and control over the code.

## How It Works

fluttercn uses a simple CLI tool to add components to your project. Components are copied directly into your `lib/widgets/` directory, making them part of your codebase from day one. You can then modify, extend, or customize them however you need.

## Philosophy

fluttercn is inspired by [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) and follows the same philosophy: we're trying to create generic, reusable components that you can copy into your project and own completely. This approach gives you the flexibility to customize everything while maintaining a solid foundation of well-designed, accessible components.

## Contributing

fluttercn is an open initiative, and we welcome contributions! Whether it's new components, improvements to existing ones, or better documentation—your contributions help make fluttercn better for everyone.
